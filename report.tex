\section{Description}
    The memory allocator was designed with two orthogonal layers. The first is
    called the `block layer', and is responsible for allocating and deallocating
    blocks at a low level. The second is called the `metadata layer'; this layer
    builds upon the work done by the block layer, and adds the ability to store
    metadata about blocks. We will describe both of these layers independantly.

\subsection{Block Layer}
    The block layer has a conceptually simple role. It is responsible for
    managing a pool of contiguous memory. Given a start memory address
    (inclusive), an end memory address (exclusive), and a block size, the block
    layer must provide two pieces of functionality. It must support allocating
    a block from the pool, and it must support freeing a block back into the
    pool. One design constraint is that it must prefer reusing a previously
    allocated block that has been freed, rather than handing out a block that
    has never been allocated before. The reason for this constraint will
    become clear when discussing the metadata layer.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:mem_block} for a pseudocode implementation of this
    layer. Note that this layer return an error-code when it runs out of
    memory. Further, this layer does some rudimentary sanity checking but
    doesn't handle some obvious error conditions. For example, this layer allows
    blocks to be inserted into the free list twice (assuming a trivial linked
    list implementation). This is not an error; it is the responsibility of
    the metadata layer to never allow this to happen. Finally, it is important
    to point out that this layer automatically zeroes memory. This is slightly
    detrimental to performance, but allows user processes to use binary
    comparisons between structs without caring about garbage in the struct's
    padding. We deemed this convenience worth the slight performance overhead.

                    \State $freeList = freeList - \{blk\}$
                    \State \Call{zero}{$blk$}
                    \State \Return $blk$

                \EndIf\\

                \State $blk \gets nextAddr$
                \State $nextAddr \gets nextAddr + blockSize$
                \State \Call{zero}{$blk$}
                \State \Return $blk$
            \EndFunction\\
            \Function{free\_block}{$blk$}
                \If {$blk < startAddr \vee nextAddr <= blk \vee endAddr <= blk$}
                    \State \Return \Comment{Outside valid range}
                \EndIf\\

                \If {$blk - startAddr \not\equiv 0 \bmod{blockSize}$}
                    \State \Return \Comment{Unaligned}
                \EndIf\\

                \State $freeList = freeList \cup \{blk\}$
            \EndFunction
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}


\subsection{Metadata Layer}
    The metadata layer builds atop the block layer, and adds the ability for the
    allocator to store metadata about blocks. Since it is built upon the block
    layer, it must fit its metadata storage in blocks. To avoid a costly setup
    phase, the metadata layer uses a lazy, arena-based storage scheme. The
    general version of the metadata layer supports an arbitrary amount of
    metadata per block ranging from some non-zero amount of metadata to half the
    block size worth of metadata.

    For the sake of description, let us call the amount of metadata fields that
    fit inside a block $k$. That is to say, one block can hold the metadata for
    $k$ blocks. The metadata layer discriminates between two types of blocks,
    data blocks and arena header blocks. The metadata layer requires a function
    that takes a block and returns its associated arena header block. For our
    purposes, this function acts as the identity function when passed an arena
    header block. These definitions lead to the notion that an arena header
    block is responsible for storing the metadata of itself, as well as the
    following $k-1$ blocks. The metadata layer is responsible for serving the
    user-facing API.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:mem_meta} for a pseudocode implementation of this
    layer. Note that this layer can also access the variables defined by the
    block layer (they can be found in Algorithm \ref{code:mem_block}). Note that
    we have elided the code of several trivial helper functions. For example, we
    did not specify the body of the `get\_header' function. We felt that the
    implementation is trivial and obvious (i.e. some simple modular arithmetic)
    enough to not waste the readers time with such minutue.

    While the metadata layer is parameterized on $k$, for our actual
    implementation, we chose $k$ to be equal to our block size; this implies
    the metadata for each process fits inside 1 byte. Indeed, we stored the
    owner pid of each block as the only metadata, and the bitwidth of the pid
    type in our system was 8.

    \begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Metadata layer pseudocode}
        \label{code:mem_meta}
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]

            \State $k \gets 2^7$
            \Comment{Blocks per arena (configurable)}

            \State $arenaSize \gets k * blockSize$
            \Comment{Arena size (in bytes)}

            \Function{request\_memory\_block}{$pid$}
                \State $header \gets -1$
                \State $blk \gets -1$ \\

                \State $blk \gets \Call{alloc\_block}{ }$
                \If {$blk = -1$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \State $header \gets \Call{get\_header}{blk}$
                \If {$blk = header$}
                    \State $blk \gets \Call{alloc\_block}{ }$
                \EndIf\\

                \If {$blk = -1$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \State \Call{set\_owner}{$header, blk, pid$}
                \State \Return $blk$
            \EndFunction\\
            \Function{free\_memory\_block}{$blk, pid$}
                \State $header \gets \Call{get\_header}{blk}$
                \If {$header = -1$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \If {$ \neg \Call{is\_owner}{header, blk, pid}$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \State \Call{set\_owner}{$header, blk, 0$}
                \State \Call{free\_block}{$blk$}
            \EndFunction
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}


\section{Theoretical Analysis}
    Both layers were carefully designed to be $O(1)$ for all operations. This
    should be trivial by inspection, as all the functions do a tiny amount of
    arithmetic, and considering we used a linked-list as the implementation of
    the free list.

    A slightly more interesting analysis is the space overhead of our metadata
    scheme. The metadata layer uses $\frac{k-1}{k}$ blocks for storing user
    data; this yields a storage overhead of $\frac{1}{k}$. For our
    implementation, we picked $k=2^7$, yielding an overhead of $0.78\%$, or a
    utilization rate of $99.22\%$.
