\section{Description}
    The memory allocator was designed with two orthogonal layers. The first is
    called the `block layer', and is responsible for allocating and deallocating
    blocks at a low level. The second is called the `metadata layer'; this layer
    builds upon the work done by the block layer, and adds the ability to store
    metadata about blocks. We will describe both of these layers independently.

\subsection{Block Layer}
    The block layer has a conceptually simple role. It is responsible for
    managing a pool of contiguous memory. Given a start memory address, an
    end memory address, and a block size, the block
    layer must provide two pieces of functionality. It must support allocating
    a block from the pool, and it must support freeing a block back into the
    pool. One design constraint is that it must prefer reusing a previously
    allocated block that has been freed, rather than handing out a block that
    has never been allocated before. The reason for this constraint will
    become clear when discussing the metadata layer.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:mem_block} for a pseudocode implementation of this
    layer. Note that this layer returns an error code when it runs out of
    memory. Further, this layer does some rudimentary sanity checking but
    doesn't handle some obvious error conditions. For example, this layer allows
    blocks to be inserted into the free list twice (assuming a trivial linked
    list implementation). This is not an error; it is the responsibility of
    the metadata layer to never allow this to happen. Finally, it is important
    to point out that this layer automatically zeroes memory. This is slightly
    detrimental to performance, but allows user processes to use binary
    comparisons between structs without caring about garbage in the struct's
    padding. We deemed this convenience worth the slight performance overhead.

            \EndFunction
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}


\subsection{Metadata Layer}
    The metadata layer builds atop the block layer, and adds the ability for the
    allocator to store metadata about blocks. Since it is built upon the block
    layer, it must fit its metadata storage in blocks. To avoid a costly setup
    phase, the metadata layer uses a lazy, arena-based storage scheme. The
    general version of the metadata layer supports an arbitrary amount of
    metadata per block ranging from some non-zero amount of metadata to half the
    block size worth of metadata.

    For the sake of description, let us call the number of metadata fields that
    fit inside a block $k$. That is to say, one block can hold the metadata for
    $k$ blocks. The metadata layer discriminates between two types of blocks,
    data blocks and arena header blocks. The metadata layer implements a
    function that takes a block and returns its associated arena header block.
    For our purposes, this function acts as the identity function when passed
    an arena header block. These definitions lead to the notion that an arena
    header block is responsible for storing the metadata of itself, as well as
    the following $k-1$ blocks. The metadata layer is responsible for serving
    the user-facing API.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:mem_meta} for a pseudocode implementation of this
    layer. Note that this layer can also access the variables defined by the
    block layer (they can be found in Algorithm \ref{code:mem_block}). Also note that we have elided the code of several trivial helper functions. For
    example, we did not specify the body of the `get\_header' function. Since
    the implementation of this function was some simple modular arithmetic, we
    did not feel it was worth wasting the reader's time with such minutiae.

    While the metadata layer is parameterized on $k$, for our actual
    implementation, we chose $k$ to be equal to our block size; this implies
    the metadata for each process fits inside 1 byte. Indeed, we stored the
    owner pid of each block as the only metadata, and the bitwidth of the pid
    type in our system was 8.

        \caption{Metadata layer pseudocode}

                \State $blk \gets \Call{alloc\_block}{ }$
                \If {$blk = -1$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \State $header \gets \Call{get\_header}{blk}$
                \If {$blk = header$}
                    \State $blk \gets \Call{alloc\_block}{ }$
                \EndIf\\

                \EndIf\\

                \State \Call{set\_owner}{$header, blk, pid$}
                \State \Return $blk$
            \EndFunction\\
            \Function{free\_memory\_block}{$blk, pid$}
                \State $header \gets \Call{get\_header}{blk}$

                    \State \Return $-1$

                \If {$ \neg \Call{is\_owner}{header, blk, pid}$}
                    \State \Return $-1$
                \EndIf\\

                \State \Call{set\_owner}{$header, blk, 0$}
                \State \Call{free\_block}{$blk$}
            \EndFunction
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}


\section{Theoretical Analysis}
    Both layers were carefully designed to be $O(1)$ for all operations. This
    should be trivial by inspection, as all the functions do a tiny amount of
    arithmetic, and considering we used a linked-list as the implementation of
    the free list.

    A slightly more interesting analysis is the space overhead of our metadata
    scheme. The metadata layer uses $\frac{k-1}{k}$ blocks for storing user
    data; this yields a storage overhead of $\frac{1}{k}$. For our
    implementation, we picked $k=2^7$, yielding an overhead of $0.78\%$, or a
    utilization rate of $99.22\%$.

\part{User-level Processes}

\chapter{Set Priority Command Process}

\section{Description}
    This process is responsible for allowing the user to change process
    priorities through terminal commands.  It is registered to the \%C command,
    and will attempt to set a new priority level to the given process ID.
    Validation is done on the input parameters to ensure that they are actually
    valid inputs before calling set\_process\_priority(pid, priority).  We check
    to ensure that we have a space between \%C, the pid, and the priority.  We
    also ensure that the pid is valid (within our allowed range of integers) and
    that the priority is valid (between 0 and 255 inclusive).  The
    set\_process\_priority process itself satisfies the requirements that the
    change be immediate and that the target process could be located in the
    ready or blocked resource queue.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:user_set_priority} for a pseudocode implementation
    of this user process.  Note that this process, among others, makes use of
    a custom implementation of a read\_uint32 helper function that we created.
    The pseudocode for that function is included in Algorithm
    \ref{code:read_uint32}.

    As a user process, we require memory in order to send a message to it (as
    the user), so we will be unable to send commands to it (as well as other
    user processes) in a situation where we are out of memory.  Therefore, we
    are unable to use this process to stop a misbehaving process that is holding
    and not releasing memory if we are already out of memory.

\chapter{24-Hour Wall Clock Display Process}

\section{Description}
    This process is responsible for acting as a digital clock, printing the time
    at one second intervals.  The user can start the clock at 00:00:00 with the
    command \%WR, can stop output with \%WT, and can set an arbitrary time using
    \%WS HH:MM:SS.  The process will reject any messages passed to it that
    either don't begin with the registered \%W command, or are malformed.

    For the \%WS HH:MM:SS command, we check that there is a space in between
    \%WS and HH:MM:SS.  As well, we make sure that there are colons in between
    HH, MM, and SS.  We also ensure that HH is between 00 and 23 inclusive, and
    MM and SS are both between 00 and 59 inclusive.

    See Algorithm \ref{code:user_clock} for a pseudocode implementation
    of this user process.  Note that this process, among others, makes use of
    a few helper functions.  It uses read\_uint32, write\_uint32, as well as
    write\_string.  See Algorithm \ref{code:write_uint32} for the pseudocode of
    write\_uint32, and Algorithm \ref{code:write_string} for the pseudocode of
    write\_string.  In addition, a user API call get\_time is also used.  This
    simply obtains the current system counter, which is incremented every
    millisecond by the timer ISR.

\chapter{Stress Processes A, B, and C}

\section{Description}
    These processes were used to stress test the system.  Process A was
    registered under command \%Z.  Upon starting, it would continuously obtain
    a memory block when possible and send it off as a message to process B,
    containing the value of a counter that it incremented every time it went
    around the loop.  Process B would redirect any messages to process C.
    Process C had its own extra message queue (on top of the one that we already
    had for each process).  If there was something in its extra queue, we would
    dequeue from that first, before processing any new messages from its regular
    queue.  Then, if we received a message from process A, we would check if the
    counter that was included is divisible by 20.  If so, we send a message to
    the CRT process to print a message to the screen, then sleep for 10 seconds.
    During this time, messages from process A (through process B) would continue
    to accumulate, eventually running out of memory when there is none left to
    use to send messages.  After waking up, C would process all the messages in
    the queue, releasing their memory, and the cycle would begin again.

    This set of operations would quickly deprive our system of memory.  It was
    designed to see how the system would respond in a no-memory situation.  When
    we ran this during testing, we would run into deadlocks in the situation
    when the priority of process C was less than or equal to process A, as
    process A only requested memory blocks, while process C was the one that
    released memory.  The scenario would be when all the memory is locked up
    inside process C's local message queue, and it blocks during the call to
    sleep (which requires an envelope in order to send itself a message).  To
    this end, we modified the sleep function such that this scenario wouldn't
    occur.  We would still be out of memory, but we wouldn't deadlock - we
    would simply undergo the 10 second cycle of flushing all memory, then being
    out of memory again until the next time process C wakes up.

    To do this, we preallocated envelopes for processes that needed to use the
    sleep function (process C as well as some of our own user-level test
    processes).  That way, sleep doesn't require a call to
    request\_memory\_block, so it's a non-blocking call (apart from the sleep
    itself).

    The pseudocode for processes A, B, and C are not included as they were
    implemented off of the given pseudocode in the project description.
    However, an additional envelope was preallocated for process C so that its
    sleep call wouldn't block.  See Algorithm \ref{code:sleep} for a pseudocode
    implementation of the sleep function, which was modified from the given
    pseudocode in order to include our additional functionality.  We also make a
    user call to pid(), which is a function returning the process ID of the
    currently running process.

\chapter{User-Level Test Processes}

\section{Description}

    We had various user-level processes that we created for the first
    deliverable, and continued to use throughout creating our OS.  As we
    continued adding more features, the user processes were modified as well.
    Most notably, they were modified in order to incorporate a sleep function,
    which we had already implemented for the second deliverable after adding
    message passing.  As we set the processes to sleep for different delays, it
    is possible to see the interleaving of message printing by the CRT process
    when their delays synchronise.  The processes are listed below.

\subsection{`funProcess'}

    This process would send 5 messages to the CRT process to print the numbers
    1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  It would then sleep for 3000 milliseconds.  This would
    be repeated indefinitely.  This process, along with the other processes, had
    to be modified for the second deliverable when we switched from straight
    UART polling to passing messages to the CRT process for printing.

\subsection{`schizophrenicProcess'}

    This process is similar to `funProcess', printing the numbers 9, 8, 7, 6,
    and 5.  It would then sleep for 4000 milliseconds.  This would be repeated
    indefinitely.

\subsection{`fibProcess'}

    This process would print the first 40 or so Fibonacci numbers.  It would
    print these 5 at a time, then sleep for 1000 milliseconds.  After reaching
    the Fibonacci number just under 1000000000, it would restart at 1.  This
    would be repeated indefinitely.

\subsection{`memoryMuncherProcess'}

    This process would request all available memory blocks, printing the
    addresses of the obtained memory blocks.  When it has obtained all available
    blocks, it would try to acquire another block, which would cause the process
    to block, waiting for an additional memory block to become available.  Prior
    to this, it would set the priority of `releaseProcess' to the highest
    possible, which would free a preallocated block of memory, allowing this
    process to continue.  After becoming unblocked, it would free all held
    memory blocks and then block on receiving a message indefinitely.

\subsection{`releaseProcess'}

    This process was used in conjunction to the above `memoryMuncherProcess'.
    At startup, this process had the highest priority.  It would preallocate a
    memory block (used to unblock `memoryMuncherProcess'), then set its own
    priority to the lowest possible.  It would then call release\_processor.
    Our other user processes were running at higher priority than this one was
    set to, so it would require a set\_process\_priority in order to get it to
    run again, provided by `memoryMuncherProcess'.  It would continue executing
    after having its priority set to the highest possible again by
    `memoryMuncherProcess', and free its single block.  After doing so, it would
    block on receiving a message indefinitely.  The combination of these two
    processes allowed us to test low to no memory situations to ensure our
    memory allocator was working as expected, as well as to ensure that our
    set/get\_process\_priority functions were working properly.
